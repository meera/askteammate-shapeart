ShapeArt is a Gutenberg block to draw customizable shapes.  

== Description ==  
ShapeArt is a Gutenberg block.  It allows content writters to insert customizable graphics in document.  
Use this block to generate headshots with blob background for your resume.

You can select from pre-defined shapes and customize it to suit your needs.  
You can customize attributes such as content, background  color and  size.  


This  is  our mantra -  
"For complex graphical needs, hire a pro graphic designer.  
For simple graphical need, use ShapeArt!"  

Major features in ShapeArt include:

* Easier for non-designers to use. Most of the graphic is prebaked - you can personalize  it to suit your need. 
* Generates SVG output, that means the image can be scaled up and down without loss of resolution.
* Light weight - it will not add blot to your page.

== Installation ==

Upload the plugin to your blog, Activate it.

Insert it and you are ready to go.
